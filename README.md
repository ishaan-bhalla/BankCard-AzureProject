### Project Overview

This was my first ever project built during my internship at Microsoft Azure. Through this project, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. I also integrated Azure Bot Services to incorporate a chatbot into the website, providing users with an interactive experience.

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Informative Content**: The site includes sections for services, blog posts, contact information, and more.

### Page Descriptions

- **Home (index.html)**: The main landing page of the website, featuring an overview of services and navigation to other sections.
- **About (about.html)**: Provides information about the bank, its mission, and vision.
- **Services (services.html)**: Lists the various services provided, including mobile banking apps, personal profiles, cheque transfers, credit/debit cards, savings accounts, and 24/7 online support.
